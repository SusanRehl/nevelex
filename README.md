# Nevelex Code Challenge

## Create a Website Dynamically Filled with Data from Animal REST API

### Background
Many of our projects require interfacing with a backend data source to populate the browser interface.  To assist us in understanding how you would develop a project using a dynamic backend data source, we have created a RESTful API for you to use to develop a quick website.

### Technical Details
- The description of the RESTful API is available the site you were given. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
- The API is seeded with three results, 1, 2, and 3, which can not be deleted.  However, all other results can be deleted.

### Goals
Create a website or single page which retrieves and manipulates information using the Animal REST API (display, view details, delete, and add animals).
The interface must utilize all the capabilities of the API.
The choice of technologies, and the look and feel of the site/page is totally up to you. Be creative and have fun with it!

## My Solution:  Welcome to the Critter5000 Animal Management System!

### Technologies Used:
AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js, Angular-UI-Bootstrap, Angular Animate, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.
